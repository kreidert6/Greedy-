# Greedy-Algorithm-Implementation

In this program you will write a greedy algorithm that reordered the elements in two lists of tuples, 
so as to satisfy certain requirements on the reordered tupes. (Details below.)

...

Your solution (which you put in the pa2 function) should, if it is possible, reorder the lists a and b so as to satisfy the following requirements:
After a and b are reordered,
• for list indices i = 1,2,...,n − 1, a[i][0] ≤ a[i + 1][0] and b[i][0] ≤ b[i + 1][0]. 
  So in the reordered lists, the first item of a tuple in a list is no bigger than the first item of the next tuple in the list.
• for all list indices i = 1, 2, . . . , n, a[i][1] > b[i][1]. 
  So in the reordered lists, the second item of a tuple in a is stricly larger than the second tuple item in b at the same index.
